# PyBer Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
The CEO has given Omar and me a new assignment: to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After conducting this analysis, I will provide V. Isualize with the analysis results and three business recommendations. 
# Results
The ride-sharing data differs among the different city types. This will be explained below:

The graph below shows the overall results of the analysis of the relationship between average fare and total number of rides while also showing the driver count per city. This is a dynamic graph that encompasses multiple elements in the ride-sharing data. From this chart we can conclude the following:
1. There is a downward trend for the average fare from rural to urban cities.
2. There is a upward trend for the count of drivers per city from rural to urban cities
3. The highest average fare is about $43-44 and was charged in the rural cities.
4. The lowest average fare is about $20 and was charged in the urban cities.
5. There are more number of rides in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.
