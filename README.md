# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The CEO has given Omar and me a new assignment: to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and then to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After conducting this analysis, I will provide the CEO with the overall results of the analysis from the PyBer ride-sharing data and three business recommendations. 
## Results
The ride-sharing data differs among the different city types. This will be explained below:

The graph below shows the overall results of the analysis regarding the relationship between average fare and total number of rides while also showing the driver count per city. This is a dynamic graph that encompasses multiple elements in the ride-sharing data in just one chart. From this chart we can conclude the following:
1. There is a downward trend for the average fare from rural to urban cities.
2. There is an upward trend for the count of drivers per city from rural to urban cities
3. The highest average fare is about $43-44 and was charged in the rural cities.
4. The lowest average fare is about $20 and was charged in the urban cities.
5. There are more number of rides in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.

Another type of charts that is relevant in this analysis is the box-and-whisker plot which would provide the CEO with a good idea on whether there are any outliers in the data and where the averages lie in comparison to others. 

The following chart is a box plot for the ride count data. According to this graph:
1. There is only one outlier which has around 39 number of rides and is located in urban cities.
2. Urban cities have a higher number of rides on average.
3. Rural cities have the lowest number of rides with about 4 and 3.5 times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The following chart is a box plot for the ride fare data. According to this graph:
1. There are no outliers in the data.
2. Urban cities have the lowest average fare for rides while rural cities have the highest average fare.
3. Rural cities have about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The following chart is a box plot for the driver count data. According to this graph:
1. There are no outliers in the data.
2. Urban cities have the highest number of drivers while rural cities have the lowest number of drivers.
3. The average number of drivers in rural cities is 9 to 4 times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Another alternate visualization that is helpful in this analysis are pie charts which are used to show percentages. The following three pie charts will showcase the percentage of fares for each type of city. Each pie wedge will represent the percentage of total fares for each city type according to the ride-sharing data percentage we are looking at.

The following chart showcases the % of Total Fares by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total fares % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % total fares are more than 50% of the % of total fares among all city types.  

![Fig5.png](https://github.com/WTAN241/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig5.png)

The following chart showcases the % of Total Rides by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total rides % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % of total rides are more than 50% of the % of total rides among all city types.  

![Fig6.png](https://github.com/WTAN241/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig6.png)

The following chart showcases the % of Total Drivers by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total drivers % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % total drivers are more than 50% of the % of total rides among all city types.  

![Fig7.png](https://github.com/WTAN241/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig7.png)

The graph below is a more detailed version that showcases the total fares by city type in the period between 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29.

![PyBer_fare_summary.png](https://github.com/WTAN241/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

According to the graph above:
1. Urban cities have the highest total fare among the three city types.
2. Urban cities are about 2 times and 4 times higher than suburban and rural cities in total fare.
3. Total fare peaked between the last week of February and the second week of March.

In sum, urban cities appear to have the highest volume and fares in terms of total rides, drivers and fares in the city. As a result of this, urban is the city type that is generating the most revenue for PyBer.

## Summary

The first business recommendation I propose is to focus on maintaining the current customer base in urban cities. This is because urban cities have the highest proportion of total fares and total rides with percentages of 62.7% and 68.4% respectively. Although urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride, the high volume of rides in urban cities is what contributes to the generation of revenue. Therefore, it is important for PyBer to maintain the existing customer base through maintaining a high amount of drivers enough to cover all the rides and even more so as to ensure ready availability. 

My second business recommendation is to focus on transferring resources to suburban cities since this could be an area of opportunity for generating revenue. According to the charts above, suburban cities rank second in total fares of 30.5% while having a lower % of total drivers of only 16.5%. Moreover, suburban cities have an average fare higher than urban cities by about $5. Therefore, if PyBer could recruit or transfer more drivers to operate in suburban cities, they could be taking advantage of this area of opportunity to generate more revenue.

The third business recommendation to the CEO is to increase resources and availability of drivers in the three city types according to when the fares peak during the season. According to the PyBer fare summary graph, the total fares peak between the last week of February to the second week of March. By allocating more resources for this time period, PyBer could be generating more revenue by supplying enough resources to meet these increased demands.
