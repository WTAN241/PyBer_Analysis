# PyBer Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
The CEO has given Omar and me a new assignment: to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After conducting this analysis, I will provide V. Isualize with the overall analysis results of the PyBer ride-sharing data and three business recommendations. 
# Results
The ride-sharing data differs among the different city types. This will be explained below:

The graph below shows the overall results of the analysis of the relationship between average fare and total number of rides while also showing the driver count per city. This is a dynamic graph that encompasses multiple elements in the ride-sharing data. From this chart we can conclude the following:
1. There is a downward trend for the average fare from rural to urban cities.
2. There is a upward trend for the count of drivers per city from rural to urban cities
3. The highest average fare is about $43-44 and was charged in the rural cities.
4. The lowest average fare is about $20 and was charged in the urban cities.
5. There are more number of rides in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities.

Another type of charts that is relevant in this analysis is the box-and-whisker plots which would provide with a good idea on how to show the CEO if there are any outliers in the data and where the averages lie in comparison to others. 

The following chart is a box plot for the ride count data. According to this graph:
1. There is only one outlier which has around 39 number of rides and is located in urban cities.
2. Urban cities have a higher number of rides on average.
3. Rural cities have the lowest number of rides with about 4 and 3.5 times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The following chart is a box plot for the ride fare data. According to this graph:
1. There are no outliers in the data.
2. Urban cities have the lowest average fare for rides while rural cities have the highest average fare.
3. Rural cities have about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.

The following chart is a box plot for the driver count data. According to this graph:
1. There are no outliers in the data.
2. Urban cities have the highest number of drivers while rural cities have the lowest number of drivers.
3. The average number of drivers in rural cities is 9 to 4 times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.

Another alternate visualization that is helpful in this analysis is to use pie charts to show percentages. The following three pie charts will showcase the percentage of fares for each type of city. Each pie wedge will represent the percentage of total fares for each city type according to the ride-sharing data percentage we are looking at.

The following chart showcases the % of Total Fares by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total fares % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % total fares have more than 50% of the % of total fares among all city types.

The following chart showcases the % of Total Rides by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total rides % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % total fares have more than 50% of the % of total rides among all city types.  

![Fig6.png](http://localhost:8888/view/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/Fig6.png)

The following chart showcases the % of Total Drivers by City. According to this graph:
1. Urban cities have the highest proportion of total drivers % by city type whereas Rural cities have the lowest %.
2. Urban cities' % total drivers have more than 50% of the % of total rides among all city types.  

In sum, urban cities appear to have the highest volume and proportion in terms of total rides, total drivers and total fares in the city.
